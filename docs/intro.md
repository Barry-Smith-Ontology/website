# About Me
											<p>My research is primarily within the field of Applied Ontology. Over the course of my career, I have authored over 700 papers and have authored or edited over 20 books. I earned my PhD in Philosophy at the University of Manchester and have held academic positions at numerous universities, including the University of Sheffield, University of Manchester, University of Leipzig, and Saarland University, amongst many visiting positions. I am a SUNY Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the University at Buffalo. From 2002 to 2006, I served as founding Director of the <a href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/institut/ifomis.html">Institute for Formal Ontology and Medical Information Science (IFOMIS)</a>, and in 2005 I founded the <a href="https://ncor.us/">National Center for Ontological Research (NCOR)</a>. Between 1992 to 2016, I also served as an editor for <a href="https://academic.oup.com/monist">The Monist: An International Quarterly Journal of General Philosophical Inquiry</a>. And from 2016 I was an editor for ISO/IEC 21838: Top Level Ontologies <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/71954.html">Part 1</a>, which outline requirements for being a top-level ontology, and <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/74572.html">Part 2</a>, which describes Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and how it adheres to the requirements in Part 1. BFO has since been adopted as a baseline standard for ontology work in the <a href="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/memo-dod-applied-ontology.pdf">US Department of Defense and Intelligence Communities</a>.</p>
